# The Bank of Sun Online Banking Application

A small local bank, The Bank of the Sun, has realised that its personal online banking offering is no longer
appropriate for banking in 2018. To this end, the bank has contracted your group to develop a new online
banking system to work with the banks existing bank end services. In order to ensure that the bank is happy
with our design and the functionality of it, they have asked us to develop a requirements specification for it,
followed by some design mockups and then a functioning prototype.
