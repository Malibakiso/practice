# The Bank of Sun Online Banking

A small local bank, The Bank of the Sun, has realised that its personal online banking offering is no longer
appropriate for banking in 2018. To this end, the bank has contracted control-alt-elite  to develop a new online
banking system to work with the banks existing bank end services. In order to ensure that the bank is happy
with our design and the functionality of it, they have asked us to develop a requirements specification for it,
followed by some design mockups and then a functioning prototype.

Control Alt Elite took the philosophy and motto of "Simplifying complexity", this can be seen in the design of the user interface itself. Making applications that have beautiful functionality and aethetics is what this online banking application aims to achieve.
